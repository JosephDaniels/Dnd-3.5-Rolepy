FUTURE FEATURES

D20 with Advantage suggestion by Coruba

New Character Maker suggestion by Coruba

SUGGESTION: !useskill by mystia
what would be cool is if we could enter items with modifiers
that it automatically adds in. For example, I have a +1 armor,
or an item that gives me +2 to cooking. It would only work for
items with straight modifiers and players would have to enter
those modifiers on their character sheets.
